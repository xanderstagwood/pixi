// one shade pattern, both at once. The two patterns that turn (dark-light-dark and light-dark-light)
// turn on the middle chip, never the second or the next to last, and that chip is the lightest or the
// darkest color of the seven:
//
//   temperature   warm to cool, or cool to warm                                 (read top to bottom)
//   shade         dark to light, light to dark, dark-light-dark, light-dark-light

// light it looks. Then every order of the colors is tried against every pair of patterns, and the
// one where each step goes the way its pattern says wins. A step that a viewer could not tell
// from level (under a just-noticeable difference) is not held against it.
